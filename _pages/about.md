# Projects
I am interested in **Time-series**, **Machine learning**, **Deep learning**,**Causal analysis**. My current focuses include:
- Time series prediction modeling.
- Time Series Causal Analysis.
- Atmospheric Science and Machine Learning Interdisciplinary.
- Interdisciplinary of Medicine and Machine Learning.

## 1.Time Series Causality Studies: Infectious Disease Dynamics

### Analysis of the main influencing factors affecting the transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Research significance and aim:

Based on an interpretable machine learning model driven by big data, a correlation model between multiple factors and the epidemic is constructed to help researchers explore treatment methods and assist policy decision makers in making public health decisions.

#### Research achievements:

1. Using machine learning and integrated learning models, a total of 10 models are used to model and analyze multi-factor data and epidemic data, aiming at different A total of more than 100 machine learning combinations have been constructed in the application scenarios, and more than 10,000 hyperparameter combination optimizations have been tried for each type of machine learning.A general model and seventy-six precise models were obtained, and the R-Squared of the model reached 0.9.
2. The machine learning model constructed in a variety of application scenarios is based on SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to build an interpretable learning analysis system, which quantifies the impact of different factors on the spread of the epidemic and calculates the impact of multiple factors on the spread of the epidemic.

### Glomerular Filtration Rate Analysis

#### Research significance and aim:

This project cooperates with the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The glomerular filtration rate is one of the important indicators to measure renal function. The accurate modeling analysis and prediction of the glomerular filtration rate can quickly judge the patient's physical condition from Treat it.

#### Research achievements: 

1. In cooperation with the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University to study glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) modeling, we collected and sorted out the physical condition and various  index data of more than 3,000 patients. Organize it into a usable dataset.
2. Modeling using machine learning and ensemble learning to predict eGFR (predicted mGFR), and The New England Journal of Medicine (The New England Journal of Medicine, NEJM)’s same subject research "New Creatinine- and Cystatin C–Based Equations to Compared with "Estimate GFR without Race", our method has higher model accuracy in the patient data of Sun Yat-Sen Third Hospital. In actual application scenarios, it can enable patients to diagnose diseases with the least cost.

## 2. Time Series Forecasting

#### Research significance and aim:

Building an air quality prediction model based on statistics and machine learning provides a scientific and reasonable basis for air pollution prevention and effective measures Theoretical basis.

#### Research achievements:

1. Based on the collection of air quality factors based on web crawler technology, a daily timing crawler is used to construct a dataset, which includes the period from 2019 to 2021 The air quality data of more than 3,000 sites in China in 2019.
2. Combining empirical mode decomposition and its derivative methods with machine learning, an improved machine learning model Decompositionensemble is proposed BLS solves the problem that the original features do not contain frequency domain features, and the final results of the experiment are compared with other 24 machines with a single feature. Machine learning modeling, the proposed method has the effect of improving the accuracy of the model in the predictive modeling of air quality.

### Broad learning system based on Savitzky–Golay filter and variational mode decomposition for short-term load forecasting

#### Research significance and aim: 

The new crown epidemic has dealt a huge blow to the economy of the world, especially the electricity market. The forecast can judge the future market economic trend. In this regard, we have constructed machine learning and neural network models for short-term forecasting of electricity consumption. This is of great significance for the power sector to formulate energy plans and ensure the safe operation of the power system.

#### Research achievements:

1. Using web crawler technology to collect electricity data, oil price data, new crown epidemic data and night light intensity data of cities such as New York City in the United States from 2017 to the present, analyze and integrate them, and build a dataset.
2. An error correction model for time-invariant systems is proposed to fit the data with high precision, which can be applied to various scenarios
