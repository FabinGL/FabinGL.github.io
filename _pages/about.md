# 🏃 About me

I am a senior undergrad student [Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.nfu.edu.cn/) in Guangzhou, China. My majoy is Intelligence Science and Technology. I was advised by [Prof. Choujun Zhan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CQjEUkAAAAAJ) in [Research Institute of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (RIBDAI)](https://www.labxing.com/gnfc-ai-lab). Currently i am in [3D-space Co., Ltd.](http://xn--ehq269cgqo6ge.xn--fiqs8s/index.php?sn=solution&fid=51) conducts interdisciplinary research on atmospheric science and machine learning.My current research focuses on **time series analysis** . I work on applying artificial intelligence to industry and public health. I am looking for a **RA/PHD** position starting in the 2024 fall. Please feel free to contact me by email. for details, please view my curriculum vitae.
