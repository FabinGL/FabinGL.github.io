# ‚úèÔ∏è Projects

I am interested in **Time-series**, **Machine learning**, **Deep learning**, **Causal analysis**. My current focuses include:
- Time Series Prediction Modeling.
- Time Series Causal Analysis.
- Atmospheric Science and Machine Learning Interdisciplinary Research.
- Interdisciplinary Research in Medicine and Machine Learning.

## üå± 1. Time Series Causality Studies: Infectious Disease Dynamics

### Analysis of the main influencing factors affecting the transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Research Significance and Aim:

Based on an interpretable machine learning model driven by big data, a correlation model between multiple factors and the epidemic is constructed to help researchers explore treatment methods and assist policy decision-makers in making public health decisions.

#### üçÉ Research Achievements:

1. Using machine learning and integrated learning models, a total of 10 models are used to model and analyze multi-factor data and epidemic data. For different application scenarios, more than 100 machine learning combinations have been constructed, and more than 10,000 hyperparameter combinations have been tried for each type of machine learning. A general model and seventy-six precise models were obtained, and the R-Squared of the model reached 0.9.
2. The machine learning model constructed in a variety of application scenarios is based on SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to build an interpretable learning analysis system, which quantifies the impact of different factors on the spread of the epidemic and calculates the impact of multiple factors on the spread of the epidemic.

### Glomerular Filtration Rate Analysis

#### üìÑ Research Significance and Aim:

This project cooperates with the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The glomerular filtration rate is one of the important indicators to measure renal function. Accurate modeling, analysis, and prediction of the glomerular filtration rate can quickly judge the patient's physical condition for treatment.

#### üî• Research Achievements: 

1. In cooperation with the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University to study glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) modeling, we collected and sorted out the physical condition and various index data of more than 3,000 patients, organizing it into a usable dataset.
2. Modeling using machine learning and ensemble learning to predict eGFR (predicted mGFR). Compared with the New England Journal of Medicine‚Äôs (NEJM) research "New Creatinine- and Cystatin C‚ÄìBased Equations to Estimate GFR without Race", our method has higher model accuracy in the patient data of Sun Yat-Sen Third Hospital. In actual application scenarios, it can enable patients to diagnose diseases with the least cost.

## üå± 2. Time Series Forecasting

### A decomposition-ensemble broad learning system for AQI forecasting

#### üçÄ Research Significance and Aim:

Building an air quality prediction model based on statistics and machine learning provides a scientific and reasonable theoretical basis for air pollution prevention and effective measures.

#### üåæ Research Achievements:

1. Based on the collection of air quality factors using web crawler technology, a daily timing crawler was used to construct a dataset, which includes the air quality data of more than 3,000 sites in China from 2019 to 2021.
2. Combining empirical mode decomposition and its derivative methods with machine learning, an improved machine learning model Decomposition-ensemble BLS was proposed. This solves the problem that the original features do not contain frequency domain features. The final experimental results, compared with other 24 machine learning models, show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of the model in air quality predictive modeling.

### Broad learning system based on Savitzky‚ÄìGolay filter and variational mode decomposition for short-term load forecasting

#### ‚ùÑÔ∏è Research Significance and Aim: 

The COVID-19 epidemic has dealt a huge blow to the world economy, especially the electricity market. Forecasting can judge future market economic trends. In this regard, we have constructed machine learning and neural network models for short-term forecasting of electricity consumption. This is of great significance for the power sector to formulate energy plans and ensure the safe operation of the power system.

#### üçÄ Research Achievements:

1. Using web crawler technology to collect electricity data, oil price data, COVID-19 epidemic data, and night light intensity data of cities such as New York City in the United States from 2017 to the present, analyze and integrate them, and build a dataset.
2. An error correction model for time-invariant systems was proposed to fit the data with high precision, which can be applied to various scenarios.
